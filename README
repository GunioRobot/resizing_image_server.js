A server to resize images and serve them immediately, implemented with node.js and Image Magick.

Example: 
Request http://127.0.0.1:8000/150/image.jpg, and it sends image.jpg in width 150 to the client, regardless if it existed earlier.

It the image exists, it will be served directly. If not, it is created, cached and then served.

The size in the URL can be anything that Image Magick accepts as geometry (http://is.gd/cjcci), if you create a directory with the geometry string. That way you can control which sizes are available.

To use, set up the following directory structure:
`-- resizing_image_server
    `-- images
        |-- originals
        `-- resized
            |-- size 1
            |-- size 2
            |-- ...

This is a alpha software.
